# Reviewing Results

Viewing the results of SCRUB can be performed in three different ways: viewing the results directly in text format, utilizing the SCRUB GUI, or pushing the results to Collaborator for peer review. The following sections will provide more information about the SCRUB GUI and Collaborator review options.


## SARIF Viewers

SCRUB is capable of export results directly to the SARIF output format. Any tools that are capable of ingesting SARIF files can be used to view SCRUB results. For more information please review the [SARIF specification](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/).


## Collaborator

Users can also push results to Collaborator directly from SCRUB. This can occur in two different ways:

- Direct invocation of the module for pushing results to Collaborator
- Automated invocation via SCRUB configuration file

**Note**: The Collaborator command line utility `ccollab` is required for pushing results to Collaborator. This utility can be found on the [Collaborator download page](https://support.smartbear.com/collaborator/downloads/).

**Note**: User credentials are required for all Collaborator uploads. After analysis has been completed and before the Collaborator upload has begun, SCRUB will prompt users to enter their Collaborator login password.


### Direct Invocation

Results can be pushed to Collaborator manually by executing the following command from the same location as you performed your SCRUB analysis:

    scrub run --targets collaborator

Please refer to the [Detailed Configuration](configuration.md) page for more information about Collaborator configuration inputs.


### Automated Invocation

There is a section of the `scrub.cfg` file that can be used for pushing results to Collaborator automatically. For more information about the expected inputs for this process, please refer to the [Detailed Configuration](configuration.md) page. SCRUB analysis will be performed normally, but before execution is completed SCRUB will create a new Collaborator review that is initialized with all of the SCRUB results.

### Collaborator Review Templates
The Collaborator section of the `scrub.cfg` includes a section where users may define a review template to be used for Collaborator uploads. This can be any template on the Collaborator server, so long as it has the custom fields SCRUB expects. These fields are listed below, along with information to configure them on the Collaborator instance. Collaborator uploads may fail if these are not configured appropriately.

| Collaborator Template Section | Field Name | Type                                                                | Default Value |
