# Troubleshooting

SCRUB produces a large number of intermediary files in an effort to make debugging errors easier. The following sections attempt to facilitate this process by providing the user with a trace of the output file production, a simplified programmatic flow, and a high level description of each routine.

## Common Error Messages

SCRUB performs different levels of fault handling and provides status messages to the user. A list of error messages, their origin, and recommended responses is provided below.

| Warning Message                | Message Origin        | Recommended Action                                           |

| Invalid micro-filter type      | do_filtering          | Micro-filtering was attempted in the source code, but an invalid micro filtering type was used. Review the source file and line to update the micro-filtering tag |
| Could not generate output file | do_filtering          | An issue occurred when trying to generate the output file, check the log file .scrub/log_files/filtering.log for more information.                                                 |
| Output file is empty           | check_output_files    | SCRUB has detected an empty output file that normally should not be empty. Review the tool log to make sure there are no issues.                                                      |

| Failed to parse file, SARIF schema version does not match SCRUB supported versions | translate_results     | The SARIF file cannot be parsed because the SARIF version being used is not supported by SCRUB. Output to another SARIF version if possible. |
